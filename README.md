# Cognizant Python Capstone Finance Tracker

This project applies core python projects to build a simple command-line personal finance tracker, allowing expense logging and viewing. The concepts include various data structures and types, exception handling, and functions.

The program can be run by executing the python file directly (python /PATH/finance_tracker.py).
